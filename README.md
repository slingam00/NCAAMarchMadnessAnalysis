## Data
The data comes from [KenPom](https://kenpom.com/) which was developed by Ken Pomeroyâ€”a college basketball statistician and columnist. I used [kenpompy](https://github.com/j-andrews7/kenpompy) which is a Python web scraper for the website. In order to use kenpompy, I had to subscribe to Ken Pomeroy's site for a small fee to access all of the different tables.
